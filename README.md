# KTH-II1302: Project and project methods
## What did I learn? 
- [x] Learned the key concepts of project processes Scrum, Kanban and XP (Whiteboard, crossfunctional teams, code review)
- [x] Learned the project roles Scrum master, tester, architect, Product Owner and Developer (PRO, dev in depth)
- [x] Learned and practiced continuous integration (IBM-Cloud, Watson-IoT, Toolchain, Git etc.)
- [x] Got experience and learned about group dynamics, communication and leadership in flatter, smaller organizaitons and projects
- [x] Learned how applications can be configured and structured in cloud services
- [x] Learned how IoT devices can be interconnected and configured to cloud platforms and its data integrated in webapplications.

## Project Description
- Vision: A full scale monitoring/security app registering movement with multiple IR sensors and multiple basestations (RaspberryPi's) interconnected in e.g an office complex. The registred events (triggered IR-sensor) and the alarms (IR-sensor activation time) is set through a login based web user interface. 
- Demo: A monitoring app registering movement with one IR-sensor and one RaspberryPi. Configure and display of the events and alarms through a basic user interface. 
## Project Documentation
Stand up meetings, retrospective, time accounting (economy) and iteration plan was created and revised for all iterations.
- Iteration 1 (2 week): Brainstorming ideas, Vision document, Scrum board, project definition, user stories
- Iteration 2 (2 week): Use case/model/specification, design and development plan, conceptual architectural model, Project plan, risk analysis
- Iteration 3 (1 week): Test plan, test cases, development, logical archtectural design
- Iteration 4 (2 week): Conceptual model/domain models, sequence diagrams, 
- Iteration 5 (2 week): Component description, ergonomy motivation, sustainable environment motivation
- Iteration 6 (1 week): Report - What is a good project process? Demo presentation
## Project Implementation
Obs, my very first Node project..
- App deployed at IBM Bluemix Cloud (integrated Git and toolchain)
  - Frontend: HTML, css, javascript (JQuery), no framework..
  - Backend: NodeJS with ExpressJS, DB2
- Device configured to IBM Watson IoT
  - Raspberry Pi running Rasbian
  - Basic IR-sensor connected to Pi 
  - Python configure, sample and filter script
